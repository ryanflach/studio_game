studio_game is a command-line game built through instruction by The Pragmatic Studio.

Through user input, the game is named and then run through a number of designated rounds.
Random play is introduced to assign treasure (points) and increase or decrease a player's health.
At the conclusion of the game (as determined by the user) a .txt file is saved with the high scores.
